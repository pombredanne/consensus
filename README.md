# Consensus
A signed list of hashes of downloads that are otherwise not distributed securely.

There exist many valuable projects that, unfortunately, are not distributed in a secure way.
Using the downloads from these projects is scary, because it is not possible to verify your download. 
Some such projects include:

- Bootstrap
- gpg4usb
- HTTPS Everywhere
- jQuery

You are *encouraged* to add additional projects to our list. You can do so by filing an issue linking to the project or, better yet, editing consensus_list.py and creating a pull request.
Projects can be added, only if they do not provide a secure distribution method. Uploading a public signing key that can only be downloaded from the same http-only website is not a secure distribution method.
